			<h2>Harry and Meghan: Who are the royals' most powerful aides?</h2>
			<p>By Daniela Relph<br>
			Royal correspondent<br>
			15 January 2020</p>

			<img class="image" src="https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/660/cpsprodpb/10361/production/_110510466_composite.jpg" alt="Meghan and Harry: MEGXIT!!!" width="">

			<p class="summary">The Queen has agreed a "period of transition" as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex search for a new role in the Royal Family.</p>


			<p>With a final decision expected in the coming days, the family's most senior advisers are now involved in negotiations. So, who are they?</p>

			<h2>Harry and Meghan</h2>
			<h3>Private secretary: Fiona Mcilwham</h3>

			<p>Fiona Mcilwham is the newest of the private secretaries advising members of the Royal Family. She now finds herself at the centre of plans to develop an entirely new way of working for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex.</p>

			<p>Joining their team in August 2019, she described herself on Twitter as a "Crown servant, diplomat, wannabe super-mum".</p>

			<p>She previously held a variety of senior diplomatic posts, including ambassador to Albania, and was a senior adviser on EU enlargement.</p>

			<p>
			Private secretaries are the royals' most powerful aides. They offer advice and guidance on political, diplomatic and constitutional issues and currently occupy a crucial position in an unprecedented time for the monarchy.
			</p>
			<p>
			As Ms Mcilwham was appointed directly by Prince Harry and Meghan, she is likely to have their trust and confidence in terms of what happens next.
			</p>
			<p>
			In these uncertain times, her role could become increasingly influential as significant decisions are made.
			</p>
			<p>
			Appointed less than a year ago, Sara Latham is the duke and duchess's front-line media contact. She has already had to deal with a whirlwind of issues, such as their split from the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's charitable foundation and legal action against various newspapers.
			</p>
			<p>
			Also handpicked by Prince Harry and Meghan, she has swiftly become influential.
			</p>
			<p>
			Communications secretaries manage the press and information the Royal Family put out. But although her official brief is to deal with the media, it is also likely she will be offering the duke and duchess personal advice.
