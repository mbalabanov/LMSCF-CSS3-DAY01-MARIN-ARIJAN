			<p>By Harry Potter<br>
			Sports correspondent<br>

			<p class="summary">Tottenham have signed midfielder Gedson Fernandes on loan from Benfica for 18 months.</p>

			<p>The 21-year-old made his debut for Benfica last season and Spurs have the option to make his signing permanent at the end of the loan period.
			</p>
			<p>
			Fernandes won the Portuguese title with Benfica last season and has played 53 times for the club, scoring two goals in the Champions League.
			</p>
			<p>
			He is Tottenham's first signing since manager Jose Mourinho took charge.
			</p>
			<p>
			Fernandes, who has two caps for Portugal, said he will settle in London alongside family who have already made the move.
			</p>
			<p>
			"It's a hard story. My family, they came to London because in Portugal, work is very hard and it's very difficult to find work," said Fernandes.
			</p>
			<p>
			"They did not have a brilliant life but they have a good life here and this is one more motivation for me to be here today. They will help me to settle here.
			</p>
			<p>
			"For me, it's one big dream to come to this big club. This is a fantastic challenge that I have accepted and I have to win my challenge."
			</p>
			<p>
			Fernandes last started a league game on 30 October having fallen out of favour at Benfica.
			</p>
			<p>
			He joins Spurs at a time where midfielders Moussa Sissoko and Tanguy Ndombele are injured, while Christian Eriksen is linked with a move away from the club.
			</p>
			<p>
			"All young players want to work with Jose Mourinho because he's one of the best - all of us as players want to stay near the best, so it's fantastic to work with him," added Fernandes.
			</p>
